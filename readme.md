# Potato Leaf Disease Prediction using CNN Fastapi

This project aims to revolutionize potato farming practices by utilizing cutting-edge deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in conjunction with Python FastAPI. By amalgamating these technologies, we are creating an innovative solution for predicting diseases in potato plants based on leaf images. Our system strives to empower farmers with accurate, timely, and actionable insights into the health of their potato crops, ultimately leading to improved yields and sustainable agricultural practices.
